# SPProject

Making a project that involves a game which people can sign into

People make an account with name and email and generate password based on questions

That password is then hashed using salt library in react

Leaderboard is displayed at end of game where people can see which users are at top

Using SQLLite to store users and need to find authentication class/library

Node.js or just JS for frontend

First Goal: Create a backbone for the project for which we can then customize

*Elijah also mentioned something about a GUI before the minigame starts
